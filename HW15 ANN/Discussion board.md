1) Name 3 successful types of healthcare applications utilizing deep learning published in the past 8 years. 
2) What are some challenges to implementing deep learning models in health care? 
3) Under what circumstances do you think deep learning will improve current approaches to health care analytics in the future? Why or why not might they succeed?

1) Disease classification
2) Sequential prediction of clinical events
3) Clinical phenotyping

The challenges to implementing deel learning models are data quality, data labeling, data heterogeneity, less interpretability and transparency, as well as deployment and automation of deep learning models.

The prediction accuracy of deep learning models will be improved for sure in the future with more rows, features, and higher quality of data and better optimized and more complex models, but these are all the aspects that hospitals, administrators, and relevant personnel should strive to improve in order to help deep learning models make better prediction.
