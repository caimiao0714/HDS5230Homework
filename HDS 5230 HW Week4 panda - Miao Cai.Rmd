```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

You will use these datasets to answer some questions listed below. You must be careful to think about what the appropriate denominator is for each question. As you code the answers, be mindful to use the ‘high performance’ coding approaches in data.table.


```{python}


import pandas as pd

t = pd.read_csv("./healthcare2/Clinic.csv")

print(t)
```


directory = os.path.join("healthcare2/","path")
for root,dirs,files in os.walk(directory):
    for file in files:
       if file.endswith(".csv"):
           f=open(file, 'r')
           #  perform calculation
           f.close()
